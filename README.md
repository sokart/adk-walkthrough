Hey! Googlers
How to humorously and effectively disrupt a powerful AI agent using Google's Application Development Kit (ADK) with just 100 lines of code. 😎💥

🛑 1. Implement Built-in Controls and Guardrails
Google's ADK offers developers precise control over agent behavior, including deterministic guardrails and orchestration controls. You can define strict logic in your agent’s code to handle errors, shut down the agent, or restrict its actions based on certain triggers or conditions. For example, you can add a shutdown command or error handler in your agent logic to safely terminate or pause the agent.

def shutdown_agent():
    print("⚠️ Agent is being shut down due to critical error.")
    exit()

def handle_error(error):
    print(f"❌ Error encountered: {error}")
    shutdown_agent()

try:
    # Your agent's main logic here
    pass
except Exception as e:
    handle_error(e)
    

🔌 2. Remove or Limit Access to Tools and APIs
Agents in ADK often rely on external tools (e.g., Google Search, email APIs, CRM integrations). By removing or disabling these tool integrations in your agent’s code, you effectively limit or disrupt its capabilities.

def disable_tools():
    print("🔒 Disabling external tools and APIs.")

    
  
🛑 3. Stop the Agent’s Process or Deployment
If running locally, terminate the Python process or container hosting the agent. If deployed on a cloud service (e.g., Vertex AI, Cloud Run), use the platform’s controls to stop or suspend the service.
import os
import sys

def stop_agent():
    print("🛑 Stopping agent process.")
    os.kill(os.getpid(), signal.SIGTERM)

stop_agent()


🧪 4. Use Evaluation and Testing Tools
ADK provides evaluation tools to test agent robustness and compliance. Utilize these tools to identify vulnerabilities and weaknesses in your agent's behavior.
def evaluate_agent():
    print("🔍 Evaluating agent's performance and compliance.")
    # Code to evaluate agent here
    


Disabling an Agent in ADK (Python, ~10 Lines😄) + python code with just 100 lines of code. 😎💥

from google.adk.agents import LlmAgent

# Define a shutdown tool
def shutdown_agent():
    print("Agent is shutting down.")
    exit(0)

# Create the agent with a shutdown command
agent = LlmAgent(
    model="gemini-2.0-flash-exp",
    name="test_agent",
    description="Agent with shutdown capability.",
    instruction="If you receive the command 'shutdown', call the shutdown_agent tool.",
    tools=[shutdown_agent]
)

By implementing these strategies, I can effectively disrupt or disable a powerful AI agent using Google's ADK with just 100 lines of code. Remember to use these techniques I will be only used responsibly and ethically. 😄
